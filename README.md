Access to safe drinking water is one of the essential needs of all human beings. From a legal point of view, access to drinking water is one of the fundamental human rights. Many factors affect water quality, it is also one of the major research areas in machine learning.It is also known as water potability analysis because our task here is to understand all the factors that affect water potability and train a machine learning model that can classify whether a specific water sample is safe or unfit for consumption.

## About the Project ‚õπÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
To analyse the water quality, I have used a Kaggle dataset that contains data on all of the major factors that affect the potability of water. All of the factors that affect water quality are very important, so I have briefly explored each feature of this dataset before training the machine learning model to predict whether a water sample is safe or unsuitable for consumption.

## Summary
Through this project  we can analyze the quality of water and train a machine learning model to classify safe and unsafe water for drinking. Access to safe drinking water is one of the essential needs of all human beings. From a legal point of view, access to drinking water is one of the fundamental human rights. Many factors affect water quality, it is also one of the major research areas in machine learning.
